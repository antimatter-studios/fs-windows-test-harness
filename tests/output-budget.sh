# WHAT THIS DOES NOT TEST. The wrapper's own behaviour suite lives in
# rust-fs-core (tests/output_budget.rs), where the script does. Duplicating it
# here would be the committed copy again in another form: two suites agreeing
# with each other and nothing comparing them. What this repository owns is the
# resolution -- which script runs, and what happens when none can be found --
# the handful of properties scripts/task.sh actually depends on, and the rule
# that a task without a budget is not a task.
#
# WHY THE REFUSALS ARE DRIVEN AND NOT READ. A refusal nobody executes has
# never been shown to happen. Both of them are here: core absent, and core
# present but answering the wrong API version.
