# tests/remote-timeout.sh -- a remote command that never returns is a named,
# bounded failure, not a silent hang.
#
# run-tests.sh talks to the Windows VM through many short SSH sessions: the
# VM-workdir lock (Acquire / Verify / Renew / Release), the ship phase, and
# the runner's one session per vm-step. On CI one of those sessions has
# stopped answering three times, and each time the job printed nothing until
# GitHub cancelled it 40 minutes (or six hours) later.
#
# This test puts a stand-in `ssh` first on PATH. It answers the preflight
# probe, then NEVER RETURNS from whichever VM-lock action the case names --
# exactly the shape of those hangs -- and asserts that run-tests.sh:
#
#   * fails, well inside a bound far shorter than the hang;
#   * names the command that stopped, and the scenario it was running for;
#   * leaves no stand-in ssh behind.
#
# A stand-in `cargo` stands in for the runner, so the run reaches the
# end-of-run Release without building anything. The runner's own per-step
# bound is covered by its unit tests (runner/src/dispatch.rs).
#
# Compatible with macOS bash 3.2. Needs python3 (as run-tests.sh does).
